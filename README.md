This is a workout tracking system. I used it personally for quite some time. I have re-written this application and separated it into UI and API repos, Lift and LiftApi. I use that system regularly in my own strength training activities.
It is heavily designed for powerlifters, but can also be used for tracking most any kind of strength training involving weights, machines, or bodyweight exercises.
